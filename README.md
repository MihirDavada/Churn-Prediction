**Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Company**

**Definition**:

- telecom company is faced with the challenge of identifying customer churn behavior and devising strategies to retain these customers.Churn refers to customers leaving our services for alternatives.

**Solution:**
- To tackle this issue, we are implementing a Machine Learning classification model. This model will predict customer behavior, helping us proactively address churn. The project involves using Python for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, and various classification algorithms to build the predictive model.

**Key Steps:**

  - Data Collection: Gather and preprocess customer data, including historical usage, billing, and demographic information.

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth data analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that may contribute to churn behavior.

  - Feature Engineering: Prepare the data by selecting relevant features and transforming them for model training.

  - Model Selection: Choose and train different classification models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

  - Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

  - Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.

  - Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into a production environment, where it can make real-time predictions.
